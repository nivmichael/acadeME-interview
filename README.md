<p>Clone or download the project and solve the following:</p>
<p><b>Task 1</b></p>
<p>Debug application so it runs with no errors.</p>
<p>Fix application routing that 'home' state would initiate on the root URL of the application ('/').</p>
<p><b>Task 2</b></p>
<p>Move 'directoryController' to its own file in 'controller' directory, and add a person on the hardcoded list (dirList.list). Make sure that the addPerson form works well.</p>
<p><b>Task 3</b></p>
<p>Create a service in 'services' folder. The service will be called in addPerson function, and send the age of the person to 'rpc.php'. (using $http)</p>
